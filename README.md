# Exploratory-Data-Analysis and Feature Engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline. It involves analyzing the dataset and summarizing its main characteristics using visual and statistical techniques. EDA helps in understanding the data, identifying patterns, spotting anomalies, and forming hypotheses that could guide further analysis or model development.

This project demonstrates the process of performing EDA on a dataset to extract meaningful insights, detect missing data, and identify potential relationships between variables.

### Plotting 2D and Univariant 

Obeserving the Distributions of each feature in Iris Dataset, Analysis and classify the target variable with plotting and Analsis.

### Haberman Survival Data Analysis
I performed various statistical analyses, including univariate and bivariate analysis, to explore the features in the Haberman Survival dataset. This helped in understanding the relationship between the features and survival status.

### Flight Prices Prediction
I applied feature engineering techniques to the dataset, focusing on extracting meaningful features from date-related and other variables. This allowed for better predictive modeling of flight prices.

### Zomato Data Analysis
I conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset, exploring each feature in detail. This included analyzing top cuisines, city-wise and country-wise food orders, and identifying key patterns.

### Black Friday Sales Prediction
I applied data analysis and preprocessing techniques on the Black Friday dataset, preparing it for predictive modeling. This included handling missing data, feature selection, and preparing the data for further machine learning tasks.
